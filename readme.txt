|-- Isle de Lux --|
Isle de Lux is a Python 3 program that generates and renders images of islands and posts them to Twitter.

|-- Dependencies --|
This program depends on Blender, the 3D modeling software, as well as the Python module Tweepy in order to talk to Twitter.

|-- Run the Twitter Bot --|
Fill in your API keys and path to Blender in the config.py text file, then run isledelux.py, and it will tweet out images.

|-- Blender Scripts --|
If you would like to play around with the Blender Python script in your own Blender scene, load up the cycles_island.py file and remove (or comment out) the bottom three lines before hitting "Run Script".
