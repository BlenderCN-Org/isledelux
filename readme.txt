|-- Isle de Lux --|
Isle de Lux is a Python 3 program that generates and renders images of islands and posts them to Twitter.

|-- Dependencies --|
This program depends on Blender, the 3D modeling software, as well as the Python module Tweepy in order to talk to Twitter.

|-- Run the Twitter Bot --|
Fill in your API keys and path to Blender in the config.py text file, then run isledelux.py, and it will tweet out images.

|-- Blender Scripts --|
If you would like to play around with the Blender Python script in your own Blender scene, load up the isledelux_GUI.py file and hit "Run Script". Be aware that the script empties out the scene before adding stuff, so don't run it in a scene full of important stuff.
